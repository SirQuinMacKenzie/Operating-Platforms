# Operating-Platforms
The Gaming Room client wished to develop their application into a multi-platform online trivia-drawing game,
and "hired" my group to consult and provide information relative to their development goals.
The attached form is the offical consultation/development report for the project, outlining each requirement
for the actual program to function as needed as well as recommendations for what systems would best support
the needs of the application.
