# Operating-Platforms
The Gaming Room client wished to develop their application into a multi-platform online trivia-drawing game,
and "hired" my group to consult and provide information relative to their development goals.
The attached form is the offical consultation/development report for the project, outlining each requirement
for the actual program to function as needed as well as recommendations for what systems would best support
the needs of the application. When working through the design document, the UML diagram was most helpful with
actual code production and development. It provided the layout for what needed to be done and how it all
worked together to create the application. When comparing the UML diagram to actual user need, I approached
it by limiting the amount of required user input. The more automated the actual game could be, with minimal
input from the user, the better in the long run for memory, security, and actual user interaction. I wanted
to keep the program simple and straightforward without requiring too many specific inputs that would lead to
more complex verification steps. Keeping in mind the basic needs of the user is important in creating an
application that will actually do what is required and will be useable by someone not familiar with the code
of the application.
